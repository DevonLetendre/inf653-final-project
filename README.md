# Node.js REST API for US States data using both Express and MongoDB.

## Project Overview
A Node.js REST API for U.S. States data built with Express and MongoDB. The API serves state-related information like capitals, populations, and fun facts stored in MongoDB, while data from a `statesData.json` file is also merged.

## Deployment
Deployed on Glitch:  
- **HTML Homepage**: `https://peat-shrub-harmonica.glitch.me`
- **API URL EXAMPLE**: `https://peat-shrub-harmonica.glitch.me/states/KS/funfact`
